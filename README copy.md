# Wholesome
## Introduction
Django Dreams is the embodiment of my dreams with Django. With science and a little bit of imagination. Here comes an app for the people most likely me and my friends. Imagine, you are out looking for things to do or eat. But you are at an impass. Nobody knows what they want to do or eat. Here is where the Wholesome app comes into play. It's a food and activity reccommendation app created by you and the few people you may hold close.
